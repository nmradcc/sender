Issue List

P - Partially completed
C - coded & compiled

General
X - test the reading of the config.ini file - bug: GetSettings() hangs (Replace persist with minini library)

	The secondary (debug port) already enumerates as an ST-Link, CDC, and MSD (as an mBed drive).
	Firmware updates are just dragged to this drive.

- finish compiling and testing the ZIP command
C - finish compiling and testing the YMODEM command
F - use the battery backed-up RAM for selected variables

- add a way for scripts to create temporary variables
- re-visit variables
    C - set a variable from a variable
    C - math on variables
    C - if/endif condition using either value as a variable
- Test the new variables
X - Make the "=" for setting a variable optional
P - Debug why some varaibles don't update until after a re-start
X - add a copy command
X - if no attributes are entered for attrib, display the current attributes
X - Add the month in three characters (Jan, Feb,...) and the support in datefmt
X - clean up help and add a colorized option (-c) Change switches to -a -s and -c
X - clean up dir so arg count and order doesn't matter
X - the script engine only executes shell commands. Add variables and scripts (re-factor ShellMain)
X - ANSI gotoxy doesn't seem to work - it does, the script we wrong

X - test the number of preambles
C - test the shell packet commands
- include and compile/debug the logging functionality
- include and compile/debug the self tests
X - make an arbitrary packet builder script command (file based ?)
X - track, when the track output is disabled the output floats, it should be set to zero
- the IDLE packet generator doesn't work - split this into 4 calls to BuildPacket to avoid buffer overflow
- Dcc_reg.gen_print crashes
- add log commands for scripts
- add a scope position output to the packet command

Command Station
- debug why the cab doesn't work when it is connected at reset
- test all of the menus
G - add the track output
- add the programming support

- finish Telnet
F - add FTP
- add TFTP

Other
F - Add a CAN tranceiver and LCC
